Synthwave - Cyberpunk

1. Introduction
	The year sholud be close to 2118... nobody knows the exact year anymore. A catastrophic nuclear explosion almost destroy the whole planet. There is very high level of radioactive fallout. Humans are in a civil war since... who knows... about 20-30 years. There are 2 main divisions - the undergrounders, who lives in cellers and city pipes under the ground, and the Ellites which were the ellite part of the society (if we can call this society).
	So, how did all this started? It was inevitable. First of all, the economic "growth" - 

2. The Undergrounders
	Most of the people in the underground are techno guys (knows a lot about technologies). Basicaly everythink around is technologies and stuff, most of the reason, that there is nothing else left... Only high tech devices, robots, computers etc. They control a lot of old nuclear power supplies (mostly termal-nuclear powered) but the main problem for the undergrounders is the oxigen. There is just not enougth oxigen for them, under the ground so they use old O2-Generators.

3. The Ellites
	The ellites were part the of the welthy and highly educated groups. Now they just have the remainings of an progressive era. The hold most of the... lets say clear energy sourses like nuclear fusion reactors or gravitational wave synthezer.
